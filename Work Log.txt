Finished implementing the CabinetDoorComponents object throughout the entire HWC 2.0 project.
Need to start working on finishing up the way the CabinetProject object handles all of the 
CabinetDoors and getting all of the CabinetDoors up and working.

Having huge troubles with getting the de-serialized ( opened projects ) to show "Saved" data for
the project specific values. It sets them just fine the first time and can be used but once
you try to open that file again the data is gone. Might have to serialize the CabinetDoorComponents 
object for every project file...? Hopefully not.

Just did some work getting all of the cutlist subclasses almost setup completely. Need to get opening numbers setup and
linear feet setup for every component. Once this is done I can start to finish building the GUI part of the
cutlists. Once this is finished and working need to figure out how to do the center rails window, and then 
the project should be close to finished...? Openings seem to be saving fine, there may be some adjustments
to the calculations for each piece or something but seems to be closing in on the end once these two things are 
completed. Also need to get comparators back in working order so the cutlists will be sortable.
